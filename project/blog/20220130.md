# 20220130

Day two of this project, and I've been less available for making any significant progress.
Two noteworthy updates:
1. Added an ownership disclaimer on the repo readme. I added these for the sake of transparency. I want anyone becoming involved with this project as a follower, contributor, or even future customer to fully understand the nature of the work and the long term motivations for its existence and progress. I <b>want</b> people to be involved in this project and while I know that the language might sound strict and cold - it's only in an effect to draft legalese without a law degree. If we get to a point in this journey where these terms have changed, then I will gladly make changes.
    - Lastly, in the event of significant contributions and significant financial gains - I intend to share the wealth with those helpful individuals. THANKS IN ADVANCE!

2. My incredible intern and previous student has been shared on this repo and the project as a whole. She is the first person I've shared this project with on Earth and she shared very kind feedback. She's also shared some great resources for research to kickoff of the landscape journey to inform the world building exercise:
