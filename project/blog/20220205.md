Really inspiring idea from Vitalik Buterin: <b>Quadratic Voting</b> - A medium by which individuals can cast more votes/vote-weights toward a decision in incrementally expensive amounts. This prevents the rich from running-away with an election by casting disproportionally many of their higher vote amounts and allowing those with stronger opinions to add in additional votes to tip the scales more heavily in their direction. This is exactly the type of information which will be valuable in the book's scheme for a direct democracy system mechanism:

Also made it through week 1 of the coursera course on Blockchain from the University of Buffalo. The course content is a B- or B, but the references to articles, papers, and content make it worthwhile. It provides many different perspectives on BlockChain, Crypto, different alt coins, etc. It does not seem technical on the face of it, but is quite technical and many of the fundamental ideas really a few read-throughs to truly understand (including consensus, proof of stake, and gas)
