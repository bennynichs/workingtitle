Today I created an NFT! The whole thing finish to end took 4 hours, most of which was me making the artwork (adobe XD) and the last hour was spent exploring how to create a wallet, sync with the NFT marketplace, post the NFT and put it up for auction.

But here it is:

Truthfully, both metamask (coin wallet) and rarify (nft exchange) completely abstract away the crypto parts from the user experience. I certainly do feel like the technology is targeting an "in-group" - even though the applications are gaining popularity, they are littered with acronyms and terminology that I am only familiar with because of the research I've been doing into this space (eth, gas, nft, hedge, etc.).

Fingers crossed for a payday, hahaha.
Thanks for reading.
