Today is focussed on gaining a deeper understanding of blockchain technology.
I started a coursera course on Blockchain today:

Novel Idea:
Everyone has a personal AI which negotiates contracts and transaction costs in the open market. The AI predicts a reasonable goods price and negotiates and just requests confirmation from its owner. It measures the current assets of the person as well as their liquidity, happiness, comfort, etc. and makes an informed offer for goods/services agreement between the other person/corporate bot. Ads are targeted with prices instead of just blanked data.
- This however could create an unfair economy as the wealthy are willing to pay more for the same good as some non-wealthy, so there is less incentive to conduct transactions with people of a lower wealth bracket. Custom pricing destabilizes "fair trade".

Also began watching Lex Fridman's interview of Vitalik Buterin:
