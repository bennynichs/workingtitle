# who
Me, Ben Nichols, a 32 year old technology enthusiast from upstate New York. My life has been filled with opportunity, circumstance, and good luck. My particular discipline has always been the business and user application of software, from inception, to execution, to iteration, and ultimately its possible decommission. In my business life I am a chameleon - looking and playing whatever part is needed to get the job done, like a good capitalist; in my academic life I try to bring energy and engagement to my students; in my private life I'm a societal hedonist - enjoying life's spoils and maximally striving for the American dream, while reveling in the journey.

I have a few things working to my advantage in this novel pursuit:
- I have read some of the 50 most well renowned science fiction novels in the past 2 years
- I refuse to remain idle
- I am perpetually learning and the topics for the book fall within my personal curricula
- I do my best learning when it can be immediately applied
- I can break down hard problems into smaller more manageable ones
- I have unwavering confidence that I can achieve anything I but my mind and enough attention towards

Some things working against me:
- I have never written a book, or a blog entry, or even a long form social media post
- I do not know common tropes and character development arcs
- I am verbose by nature
- I tend to boil the ocean for a cup of a coffee
- I can probably only afford 1 hour per week day and 3 hours per weekend day


# what
This project has both sprung up on a whim and has been marinating for the past few years, since around 2016, in the form of "I want to write a book". I have toiled with the notion of non-fiction (in the form of o'reilly style textbooks) and fiction - but I feel there is much more wiggle room in fiction than non-fiction. Non-fiction, unless a memoir or autobiography, requires expertise in a field, and there isn't one I feel I can contribute to with authority and a non-guilty conscience. Fiction, on the other hand, holds the possibility of getting lucky with the world the author's built. Since everything written is grounded in the hypothetical and make believe, its harder (but not unlikely) to be fact-checked and exposed as a fraud. I am hoping to get lucky and write something that resonates with people and brings them some type of satisfaction.

Now, once a theme for the book was conceived - direct-democratic society with guaranteed secure participation and maximum transparency - I recognized an opportunity to write the book in a style in line with the content of the book itself. This is meant to serve a number of purposes:
- If this book were ever a success, some people would find great intrigue into the workings of how the book was made, adding to the impact of the book's full experience.
- If this book were ever a success, it proves that anyone can write a book!
- If this book were ever a success, the change log can be studied for understanding the human creative process of invention.
- The book experience can allow for creating a captivated audience before the book is even sent to a publisher, making financing and funding an easier acquisition, or even self accomplished.
- Accept ideas, revisions from the community to make the book better than it would have been as its sole contributor.


# when
I am starting this journey on a Saturday in January. The weather in Upstate NY is cold, but nothing special about today.
This project will likely be a multiyear effort, no promises that it will even be finished. Thank you for your patience.

# where
From my home in Upstate NY and synced with github. As an audio-book and e-reader, I want the final form to be multi-media formatted: hard copy, electronic copy, audio, and graphical as well.

# why
There are a number of reads why I am writing this book and meta-book:
- As previously stated, I am a capitalist, so a financial reward for the time spent in this endeavour is motivating
- I am interested in creative outlets, in particular world building, systems, and economics
- I want to leave behind a legacy, and a physical manifestation of creativity suffices
- I live off of praise and recognition. This creative style of book creation allows me to hedge:
    - A great book with an awesome experience through blogging and documentation is a home run
    - A mediocre book with an awesome experience through blogging and documentation will increase the value of the book
    - A bad book with an awesome experience through blogging and documentation becomes an artistic endeavor for study
    - A mediocre book with a mediocre experience through blogging and documentation is admirable and comes with fringe notoriety in applicable social circles.
    - A bad book with a mediocre experience through blogging and documentation is a failed experiment but still something I can use as a conversation piece.
    - A bad book with a bad experience through blogging and documentation is the same as having just written a bad book in the first place, and I can pretend it never happened - decommissioning the repo!

# how
<i>I have unwavering confidence that I can achieve anything I but my mind and enough attention towards</i> <b>(see above)</b>. This brute force approach to accomplishing anything happens via the following activities:
- Research: books, articles, interviews, youtube, among other avenues
- Breaking difficult problems into smaller more manageable chunks
- Decomposing a problem through abstraction and first planning from high level, working out the journey, then executing.
- Relaying on examples and templates, but also recognizing when to deviate and act independently
- First building a fully realized world behind the scenes which informs behavior: individual and societal
