## Meta Theme
### This is not a book; this is the creation of a book.
This repo will serve initially as a log of the author's research, works-in-progress, and synchronized commentary.

In the long shot chance that this work gains an audience, additions and subtractions will be entertained from the perspective of crowd sourcing editorial work to the community.

## Main Themes

### Technology
At its onset, the nature of this work involves the extension and possible conclusions of software technology trends, circa 2022. This will include:
- Crypto/Blockchain/Distributed Ledgers
- Machine Learning/Recommender Systems/Natural Language Processing
- Identify Management/ Bio Authentication
- Zero Trust Network/Zero Knowledge Proof
- Wearable Technology/ Augmented Reality
- User Experience/ Universal Design

### Government
With realtime, distributed, trusted, networked systems, proxies can be abolished and the power of society put into the hands of the individual, yielding a technocratic direct democracy. No more need for elections, formal committees, or political parties, the absence of which yields distributed authority. How far can this concept be extended?...
