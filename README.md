# workingtitle
This is me writing a book, writing about writing a book, eventually assembling a physical/digital representation of the book, and tracking the progress of all these activities. As far as I know there is no name for this set of related functions, so henceforth I'll refer to the general contributions to this body of work as "book building". 

## Meta Theme
#### Book Building: This is not just a book; this is also the creation of a book.
This repo will serve initially as a log of research, works-in-progress, and synchronized commentary.

In the long shot chance that this work gains an audience, additions and subtractions will be entertained from the perspective of crowd sourcing editorial work to the community.

## Main Book Themes

### Technology
At its onset, the nature of this work involves software and hardware technology trends, circa 2022, their anticipated trajectories over the next decade, and their logical/possible conclusions sometime thereafter. This will include topics such as:
- Crypto/Blockchain/Distributed Ledgers/ Web3.0
- Machine Learning/Recommender Systems/Natural Language Processing
- Identity Management/ Bio Authentication
- Zero Trust Network/Zero Knowledge Proof
- Wearable Technology/ Augmented Reality/ Metaverse
- User Experience/ Universal Design/ Technical Literacy

### Government
With realtime, distributed, trusted, networked systems, proxies can be abolished and the power of society put into the hands of the individual, yielding a technocratic direct democracy. No more need for elections, formal committees, or political parties, the absence of which yields distributed authority. How far can this concept be extended?...

## Direct Literature Influences
- <b> Isaac Asimov's Foundation Series</b>: Where psychohistory is the main character and the human characters primarily serve to push the agenda forward.
- <b> Neil Stephenson's Snow Crash</b>: Novel exposition setting/world building; blends of mysticism, cult-behavior, and blending of technology and biology to manipulate the masses.
- <b> George Orwell's 1984</b>: Specifically "The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism", the book within the book 1984 and the sociopolitical feedback mechanisms.
- <b> Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel</b>: How environments influence populations and power structures.
- <b> Cixin Liu's 3 Body Problem<b>: Specifically the plot device of the Wall Facer Project.
